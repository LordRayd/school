sms32v50 for Windows95/98/NT/2000/XP
====================================


1. The program's purpose
========================

x86 Microprocessor Simulator for students of low level programming.

sms32v50.exe is a Microprocessor Simulator based on the x86 
architecture. It is intended for students learning low level 
programming for the first time.  It is written for 
Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP.

The simulator is based on the low eight bits of the 8086 chip.  
It can be single stepped or continuously run.  The CPU registers, 
and RAM contents are made visible.

The simulator is programmed in 8086 like assembly code.  This 
is assembled into machine code that is NOT the same as 8086 code.

It is possible to control simulated traffic lights, seven
segment displays, a heater and thermostat, a stepper motor, a
lift and a snake in a maze.  CALL, RET, INT, AND IRET are 
available in the registered version.  Serious programming 
problems like multiplexing, procedures, parameter passing, 
interrupts and recursion can be tackled.

There is on-line help stored in a Windows Help file.

This upgrade from V2.3 adds a keyboard and numeric keypad. Several
bugs have been fixed and no doubt some new ones created. The user 
interface had been updated.

2. How to install
=================

Create a folder for the software.  

Unzip the distributed file into this folder.

Run the simulator by double clicking sms32v50.exe.

Create shortcuts to the program if you wish.

It is recommended that students are not given all the example 
files.  Students should be given all the numbered examples such as 
02tlight.asm and 99snake.asm.  They should also have demo.asm.

Teachers can use the other examples as they wish.  Many examples
are solutions to the student exercises.

Network Installation
====================

On a network, the program should be installed in a read only 
directory and run from a directory with write permission for 
the user.  User preferences are saved in the student's working 
directory in sms32v50.ini.  The program looks for help and user 
registration files in the program's exe file directory.  The 
shareware version has no user registration file.  If sms32v50.ini 
does not exist, it will be created with default values.


3. This Program is Shareware
============================

Educational institutions are encouraged to register.  Students may 
use the registered or un-registered software free of charge.  The 
registered version is unlocked by purchasing a software key.  If 
you have a key for a previous version, it will work with this 
version also.

Students should, whenever possible, obtain the registered version 
from their school, college or university.  Registered sites have 
permission to run unlimited instances of the program on their site.  
They may also print and photocopy any of the documentation.

As an encouragement to register, four extra machine instructions are 
available in the registered version.  Complete beginners do not need 
these instructions but serious low level programmers do.  The bonus 
instructions are CALL, RET, INT and IRET.  A simulated hardware 
timer interrupt is also available in the registered version.


4. The program is freely distributable
======================================

The complete unmodified shareware file set may be distributed freely.
Re-packaging for different media is permitted.
